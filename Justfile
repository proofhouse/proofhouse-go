# This is the inner-loop coverage gate. Pair with `just mutate <path>`

# --- Security ---

# govulncheck walks the call graph and reports only vulnerabilities whose
# vulnerable symbols this module actually calls — quieter than
# module-level scans and a closer match for what would show up in
# production. Pinned as a `go tool` dep in go.mod so the scanner version
# is reproducible across machines; bumped via Renovate.

# Scan the module for known vulnerabilities reachable from the binary entry points.
vuln:
    go tool govulncheck ./...

# govulncheck exits 0 in SARIF mode whether or not it finds
# vulnerabilities — the report carries them — so this recipe surfaces
# findings through Code Scanning rather than failing the run, while a
# genuine scanner failure still exits non-zero.

# Emit the govulncheck results as SARIF to <file> for the security.yml upload.
vuln-sarif file:
    go tool govulncheck -format sarif ./... > "{{ file }}"

# `gitleaks git` walks every commit's diff against the bundled
# regular-expression and entropy rule set; findings name the file, line,
# commit, and matching rule so the offending change can be located
# without re-running the scan. The scan runs from the digest-pinned image
# above, so the rule set advances only when Renovate moves that pin. A
# later workflow under `.github/workflows/` re-runs the same scan on
# every PR.

# Scan the working tree and full git history for committed secrets.

# Uses the external gomodscan tool (extracted from this repo's former
# tools/depscan and tools/malscan) to flag two supply-chain concerns:
# dependencies that pkg.go.dev marks as retracted at the pinned version
# or deprecated at the latest version (S2C2F SCA-3), and dependencies the
# OSV malicious-package registry flags as malware under the MAL- ID prefix
# (S2C2F ING-3). gomodscan reads vendor/modules.txt for the module set, so
# run `just vendor` first when it is stale. Exits 1 on findings, 2 on tool
# failure. Pinned as a `go tool` dep in go.mod so the local and CI
# versions match, the same as the other scanners in this section.

# Scan each vendored module for supply-chain concerns in one pass.
gomodscan:
    go tool gomodscan

# Unlike the gomodscan gate recipe, a findings exit (1) does not fail
# this recipe — Code Scanning surfaces severity downstream — but a tool
# failure (exit 2) still propagates.

# --- Aggregators ---

# Composed quality gates so a contributor hits one recipe instead
# of chaining the underlying single-purpose recipes from memory.
# Each aggregator names its dependencies and adds no extra logic,
# so any failure points at the actual gate that fired rather than
# at the wrapper.

# tidy normalizes go.mod / go.sum first so the rest of the gate sees the
# canonical dependency set; vendor-check at the end catches any drift the
# rest of the gate introduced.

# Fast quality bar for save-time and routine pre-push runs.
check: tidy verify lint test vuln vendor-check

# Layers the race detector, the inner-loop fuzz sweep (30 seconds per
# target by default; override via FUZZ_TIME), and the full-history
# gitleaks scan on top of `check`. Slower than `check` by minutes rather
# than seconds, so kept off the inner-loop path.

# Comprehensive quality bar for release-prep sweeps.
check-all: check test-race fuzz gitleaks

# Pairs govulncheck with the gomodscan and gitleaks scanners so a future
